<h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/clone-a-linked-list-with-next-and-random-pointer/1">Clone List with Next and Random</a></h2><h3>Difficulty Level : Difficulty: Hard</h3><hr><div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You are given a special linked list with&nbsp;<strong>n</strong>&nbsp;nodes where each node has two pointers a&nbsp;<strong>next pointer</strong>&nbsp;that points to the next node of the singly linked list, and a&nbsp;<strong>random pointer</strong>&nbsp;that points to the random node of the linked list.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Construct a&nbsp;<strong>copy</strong>&nbsp;of this linked list.&nbsp;The copy should consist of the same number of new nodes, where each new node has the value corresponding to its original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list, such that it also represent the same list state.&nbsp;None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Return the&nbsp;<strong>head</strong>&nbsp;of the copied linked list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>NOTE :&nbsp;</strong>Original linked list should remain unchanged.<br>Each node of the linked list is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>val</strong> represents node.data.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>random_index </strong>(1-based index) represents the index of the node that the random pointer of the current node points to, or <strong>NULL </strong>if it does not point to any node.</span></li>
</ul>

<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input: </strong>head = [[1, 3], [3, 3], [5, NULL], [9, 3]] <br> &nbsp; <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/img-practice/prod/addEditProblem/700186/Web/Other/blobid0_1756531264.jpg" width="433" height="147"><br><strong>Output: </strong>[[1, 3], [3, 3], [5, NULL], [9, 3]]<strong>
Explanation: </strong>
Node 1 points to Node 3 as its NEXT and Node 5 as its RANDOM.
Node 3 points to Node 5 as its NEXT and Node 5 as its RANDOM.
Node 5<strong> </strong>points to Node 9 as its NEXT and NULL as its RANDOM.
Node 9 points to NULL as its NEXT and Node 5 as its RANDOM.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input: </strong>head = [[1, 3], [2, 1], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 2]]<br> &nbsp;<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/img-practice/prod/addEditProblem/700186/Web/Other/blobid1_1756531275.jpg" width="456" height="133"><br><strong>Output: </strong>[[1, 3], [2, 1], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 2]]<strong>
Explanation: </strong>
Node 1 points to Node 2 as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
Node 2 points to Node 3 as its NEXT and Node 1 as its RANDOM.
Node 3 points to Node 4 as its NEXT and Node 5 as its RANDOM.
Node 4 points to Node 5 as its NEXT and Node 3 as its RANDOM.
Node 5 points to NULL as its NEXT and Node 2 as its RANDOM.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input: </strong>head = [[7, NULL], [7, NULL]]<br><strong>Output: </strong>head<strong> </strong>=<strong> </strong>[[7, NULL], [7, NULL]]<strong>
Explanation: </strong>
Node 7<strong> </strong>points to Node 7 as its NEXT and NULL as its RANDOM.
Node 7 points to NULL as its NEXT and NULL as its RANDOM.</span></pre>
